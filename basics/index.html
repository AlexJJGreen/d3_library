        Let's do a high-level overview of D3.js.
    </p>
    <h3>Binding Data to the DOM</h3>
    <p>
        Basically, D3 allows for data to be <i>bound</i> to DOM elements and
        then manipulated.
    </p>
    <h3>Enter, Update, Exit Pattern</h3>
    <p>
        How this foundational concept works is a three-part pattern:
        <strong>Enter, Update, Exit</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enter:</strong> Is the process of adding new nodes for data items that currently do not have one.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Update:</strong> Is the modification of existing nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Exit:</strong> Is the remvoval of nodes.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Scales</h3>
    <p>
        Scales are functions that map a <strong>domain</strong> to a <strong>range</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>Axes</h3>
    <p>
        The visual representation of scales.
    </p>
    <h3>SVG Manipulation</h3>
    <p>
        D3 normally uses SVGs to render charts.
    </p>
    <h3>Transitions and Animations</h3>
    <p>
        D3 allows for dynamic behaviour in charts and visualisations.
    </p>
    <h3>Interactions</h3>
    <p>
        With this dynamic behaviour comes the ability for user interaction with the visualisation.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Layouts
    </h3>
    <p>
        Data can be visualised using pre-built algorithms to display certain charts.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Geo Features
    </h3>
    <p>
        Similarly, the D3 library comes with support for rendering geographic information such as maps.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Data Loading and Formatting
    </h3>
    <p>
        The data inputs for these charts can come from a variety of sources supported by the library.

    <h2>Scales and Axes</h2>
    <p>
        As the core concepts and components of D3, Scales and Axes require a fundamental understanding.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Scales
    </h3>
    <p>Scales are functions that take an input (from the domain) and produce an output (in the range). The common
        misconception is that the domain and range represent the X and Y axis, this is <strong>NOT</strong> correct! The
        domain represents the potential values of your data, the range represents how those will be displayed as pixels
        on the screen.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Domain</strong>
    <p>
        The domain is the set of possible values for your scale. For example, the domain of a linear scale in a test
        graded from 100 would be [0,100].
        <br><br>
        In an ordinal scale of fruits, the domain may be [apple, banana, melon].
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Range</strong>
    <p>
        The range then is the possible set of outputs produced by a scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can think of this like any mathematical forumala and graph. Essentially the domain is the potential inputs
        (<i>x</i>), the scale is the formula or function for that input value (<i>f(x)</i>) and the range is the
        potential output values of that (<i>y</i>).
        <br><br>
        What this means is simply, when given a value from the defined domain, D3 converts it to the given range.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Building a Dynamic Axis</h2>
    <p>
        So while it may be easier to start with a simple static axis, the reality is almost all webapps need to be
        dynamic these days so may as well start with responsive values. Here is the process.
    </p>
    <h3>Select the SVG and determine its width</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Set up the Linear Scale</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Generate the X-Axis</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Render the X-Axis on the SVG</h3>
    </p>
